# Basic Website
  I made this as part of a tutorial on HTML, but went a bit further and included some javascript and CSS for fun. 
  The idea was just to practice anyways. It reads as a portfolio website but I might be a bit embarassed for someone to consider
  this repo as my portfolio. Not because there is anything wrong with the repo/site, jsut that I would want to make it much fancier
  if I knew a potential employer were judging me based on this. I wouldn't mind if someone wanted to add to this for fun. 
  
 ## Getting Started
  ### Prerequisites/installing/deploying
    I've lumped these all together because there isn't much to say about them. 
    1. Run `git clone` followed by the url which can be found if you click on the green button near the top right of this repository.
    * HTML, CSS, and Javascript are used in this repo. These are pretty standard tools so any text editor will do. 
      * If you don't have a text editor then you can even download the files, drag the index file into your browser and run it that ways.
