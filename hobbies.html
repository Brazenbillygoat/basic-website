<h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Running - Long distances, I consider 6 miles an average day. This varies directly with my current fitness level.</li>
            <li>Reading - I read almost any genre and especially autobiographies, scifi, or history.</li>
            <li>Programming - Is it too cheesy to say that? Maybe it could be better said as 'Learning', but especially technological and home improvement topics.</li>
            <li>Climbing - Taking logical puzzles into a tangible space. Very zen. <a id="climber" href="./images/climber.jpg" target="blank">Photography</a> is very much intertwined with this hobby as I love photographing <a id="kayaker" href="./images/kayaker.jpg" target="blank">all adventure sports</a>.</li>
